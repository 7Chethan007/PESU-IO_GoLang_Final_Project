## Features
- User authentication (Sign In and Sign Up)
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- RESTful API using Gin framework
- JSON-based data handling
- JWT Authentication for secure user sessions
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Coming Soon)



## Middleware and JWT Authentication
This project uses middleware for logging and JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. The middleware ensures that all requests are logged, and JWT is used to secure endpoints by verifying tokens.

## Testing
To run tests for the project, use the following command:

```sh
go test ./...
```
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a pull request.
